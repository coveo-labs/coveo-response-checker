<h1>Coveo Request Checker</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Coveo Request Checker is 
  to give developers/clients/partners the ability to quickly 
  check and validate the Coveo Requests.

A Coveo Request could be:
<ul><li>Search Calls</li>
  <li>Analytic (legacy) Calls (including beacon events)</li>
  <li>Analytic E Commerce Calls</li>
</ul>

Each request must match minimal requirements. 
The Chrome extension will show you exactly which fields are properly set, and which events you are sending. 
Using the extension you can quickly validate if your implementation meets the criteria.

</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
You can use the extension in 2 ways: using the normal UI, or by using the DevTools UI.
The normal UI will give you an aggregate of all the events captured by the extension.
The DevTools UI will have a tab called 'Coveo Request Checker', that will give you details for each event captured.
Downloading the report will also download the detailed requests.
